⚈Introduction
This project aims to build an efficient and accurate COVID Detection System (CDS) using transfer learning to classify X-ray images of patients into two classes:
normal and COVID-19 positive cases. 
The system will aid healthcare professionals in making quicker and more accurate decisions for potential cases of COVID-19 using X-ray images.

●Problem Statement
The primary goal of this project is to minimize false predictions while accurately identifying COVID-19 positive cases through X-ray images.

⚈Proposed Solution
Our solution involves using transfer learning, where we leverage pre-trained deep learning models to achieve accurate COVID-19 detection from X-ray images.

⚈Tech Stack used
Python
FastAPI
Docker
GitHub Action
Airflow

⚈Infrastructure Required
AWS S3: Used for storing datasets and model artifacts.
AWS ECR: Container registry to store Docker images.
AWS EC2: Virtual server for deploying the FastAPI application.
Git: Version control system for collaborative development
